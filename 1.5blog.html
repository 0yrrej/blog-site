                <p>2c<br>A beneficial effect of smartphones on society is how people interact with the world 
          in a more  efficient way. Many people use smartphones as a tool, besides from entertainment. 
          For example, being able to answer a question you have makes is more efficient then having to 
          look for it in a book maybe.The convenience of having a machine to help you answer a question 
          saves time. Being efficient with your time allows for more time for other activities, which 
          is a great thing if you are limited on time. When attempting to complete a task, a smartphone 
          could help do it a bit faster. However, smartphones still have harmful effects, like being 
          less interactive with others. People tend to go the easy route , which a smartphone could 
          provide when trying to figure out something. People would be less likely to ask someone for 
          help because their smartphone could most likely answer their question for them. People would 
          get use to being helped by a smartphone that they would less than often ask a person for 
          assistance. This would lead to more people being unsocial. That would make it difficult for 
          those people to interact with a person when lost, thus making them have difficulties in their 
          communication skills.</p>
          
                <p>2d<br>Smartphones are able to receive, send, and hold data. Smartphones receive data through signals
          sent and received to antenna towers. This allows for data to be sent and received. This data 
          can in the form of text, images, or code. The data is then processed by the smartphone to 
          produce what the user is looking at. This could be images, texts from others, or code for apps 
          and games. In addition, sending and receiving data is not the only thing smartphones do with 
          data. Smartphones are able to hold data and use it when needed as well. Image, text, app, and 
          game data can be saved for offline use. It can also present data for later use. For example, 
          an alarm can be set to ring when the data of time is inputted. Being able to have access to the 
          same information as a computer, with additional features, on a smaller device allows for mobile 
          access. With this mobility comes risks of security concerns. If this mobile device with 
          precious information of the user is lost or stolen it could be found and used in the wrong way. 
          Smartphones do have security measures for this, unless the user never set up the security 
          measures, but nothing is impossible to get into on a smartphone. Smartphones are able to send, 
          receive, and store data, but the data stored on a smartphone is not always secure.</p>
