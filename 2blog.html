                <p>2a)<br>Amazon was intentionally created as an online book store. However, 
                Amazon shifted away from only books to what is now the largest e-commerce marketplace. 
                Amazon is able to connect worldwide merchandisers with consumers by playing the 
                middleman in product storage, marketing, and delivery. Firstly, Amazon stores products 
                for sellers in warehouses in adjacent to posting the products on their website. 
                Secondly, Amazon is able to market various types of products through algorithms that 
                advertise to all types of consumers. Lastly, Amazon appeals to consumers through its 
                fast delivery options. My artifact shows visuals representing Amazons function on the 
                e-commerce marketplace.

                I used the graphic design website Canva(www.canva.com) to construct my computational 
                artifact. I used both Canva's and Google's(www.google.com) image search engine which 
                outputted descriptive images relative to my input search. Utilizing Canva's easy to 
                maneuver setup I was able to illustrate how Amazon connects consumers to the worldwide 
                market. I used arrows and text templates provided by Canva to illustrate Amazons process 
                from start to finish. Canva's editing options allowed me to crop and edit images to 
                compliment Amazons process.

                Amazons impacted on way consumers and merchandisers interact has changed with the 
                introduction of Amazon's delivery service. To begin with, Amazon delivers six days a 
                week, which can deliver items within a few hours along with extra fees. People would 
                rather pay these extra fees to have products delivered to the them. This fast delivery 
                service is preferred by people who do not want to leave their home to purchase a 
                product. The convenience of not having to leave your home or interact with an employee 
                is what interests people to use the service. In addition, as source 1 says, Amazon 
                helps connect small businesses with world wide consumers without the responsibility of 
                delivery. Amazon's delivery service assists in quick delivery from most sellers to 
                consumers. This gives the customers a wider scope of product options that is 
                accumulated and verified on a single website. Consequently Amazon has improved the 
                way consumers find products from world wide merchandisers.
                <br><br>
                On the other hand, Amazon has negatively impacted retail stores. Since Amazon's 
                intended purpose is to provide creative online alternative to product purchasing, 
                it has left retail stores behind. As source 3 say, traditional retail stores have 
                seen a decline is purchases. This is due to Amazon's creative efficient services and 
                competitive prices. Consequently, traditional retail stores have had to close many of 
                their stores in efforts to lower expenses.

                Amazon uses customer data from interests, searches, and demographics to recommend 
                various products. To expand, the data that Amazon consumes is collected in a profile 
                that improves product advertising. These profiles are matched with other similar 
                profiles to improve the algorithm that promotes products.
